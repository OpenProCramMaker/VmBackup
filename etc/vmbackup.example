##### Configure core settings #####

# Type of share backup_dir is on ( currently supports nfs and smb )
# NOTE: Path seperators will be automatically switched ( / vs \ )
#share_type = nfs

# Directory where data will be backed up to
#backup_dir = /mnt/VmBackup/exports

# Minimum percentage of space remaining for backup_dir before backups
# are prevented
#space_threshold = 20

# Maximum number of previous backups to keep for each VM/VDI
#max_backups = 4

# Enable compression during export (vm-exports only, True/False)
#compress = False

# Format for vdi exports (supports raw or vhd)
#vdi_export_format = raw

# Backup pool DB to save VM metadata in case of corruption or disaster (True/False)
#pool_backup = False

# Backup dom0 in case of disaster (True/False)
#host_backup = False

##### VM selections #####

# Exclude VMs from vdi-export or vm-export (comma separated list of VM names or regex)
#excludes = DEV-.*, TSTVM02

### vdi-export ###

# Export VDI but select specific disks (Disks are semi-colon(;) separated)
# NOTE: max_backups must be specified in order to specify disks to backup,
# however, -1 in place of max_backups leaves default setting if desired
#vdi_exports = MYVM01:-1:xvda;xvdb,MySql123:5:xvdb,PRD-LNXVM.*

### vm-export example ###

# Export entire VMs but override one VM's max_backups setting to 2
#vm_exports = MYVM02:2,MySql345,PRD-.*
